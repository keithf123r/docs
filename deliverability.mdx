## Understanding Email Deliverability

Think of email deliverability as your email's journey from send to inbox. Just like a postal service needs to verify a letter's sender and ensure it reaches the right address, email systems need to trust your messages before delivering them to recipients' inboxes.

<Note>
  Did you know? Up to 20% of legitimate emails never make it to the inbox. Alice helps you beat those odds!
