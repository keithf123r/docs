## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- An active Alice account
- Admin access to your organization's HubSpot account

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to Integrations

1. Log in to your Alice account
2. Go to Settings
3. Click on "Integrations"

### Step 2: Connect HubSpot

1. In the Integrations page, locate the HubSpot card
2. Click on the HubSpot integration card
3. You'll be prompted to authorize the connection between Alice and HubSpot
4. Click "Install" to begin the authorization process
5. Follow the HubSpot login prompts if you're not already logged in
6. Grant the necessary permissions when prompted

### Step 3: Configure Data Mapping

After successful installation, you'll be automatically redirected to the HubSpot integration settings page where you can configure:

<AccordionGroup>

### Step 4: Configure Sourcing Exclusions

This helps prevent duplicate outreach by setting rules for which prospects Alice should not source:

  <Card title="Contact Exclusions">
    - Enable/disable contact matching
    - Alice will not source prospects that have matching emails with existing HubSpot Contacts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Company Exclusions">
    - Enable/disable company matching
    - Alice will not source contacts from companies that already exist in HubSpot
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deal Exclusions">
    - Enable/disable deal matching
    - Alice will not source companies that already have deals in HubSpot
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Step 5: Configure CRM Push Settings

Set up when and how Alice should update HubSpot:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Trigger Events">
    Choose which events should trigger updates in HubSpot:
    - Lead Sourced
    - First Email Sent
    - Follow-up Email Sent
    - Positive Reply
    - Negative Reply
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Event Actions">
    For each event, you can:
    - Enable/disable the sync
    - Choose which HubSpot entities to update (Contacts, Companies, Emails)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 6: Verify Integration

<Check>The integration status should show as "Complete" with a green indicator</Check>

You can test the integration by:
1. Creating a new campaign in Alice
2. Verifying that the data appears in HubSpot as configured

## Important Notes

  <Card title="Prevent Duplicates" icon="copy">
    Enable sourcing exclusions to prevent duplicate outreach
  </Card>
