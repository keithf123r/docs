      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

## Important Notes

<Warning>
All data syncing between Alice and Salesforce happens automatically once the integration is set up
</Warning>

<Info>
- You can modify your configuration at any time by returning to the Salesforce integration page
- If you need to update the field mapping, click the edit (pencil) icon next to the Mapping section
- If you need to disconnect the integration, you can do so from the same integration page
</Info>

## Support

If you encounter any issues during setup:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Check Permissions" icon="lock">
    Verify you have the necessary permissions in both Alice and Salesforce
  </Card>
  <Card title="Edition Support" icon="building">
    Ensure you're using a supported Salesforce edition
  </Card>
  <Card title="Get Help" icon="headset">
    Contact Alice support if you need additional assistance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This completes your Salesforce integration setup with Alice. The integration will now automatically sync relevant data between the two platforms according to your configured settings.
