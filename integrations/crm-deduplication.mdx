## How It Works

### Deduplication Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Record Identification">
    When new records are created or updated, Alice's deduplication engine automatically scans for potential duplicates using multiple matching criteria:
    - Email address (primary identifier)
    - Domain name
    - Company information
    - Contact details
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Matching Analysis">
    The system applies sophisticated matching algorithms to determine duplicate probability:
    - Exact match detection
    - Fuzzy matching for similar records
    - Cross-field validation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Record Resolution">
    When duplicates are identified, the system:
    - Automatically merges records based on configured rules
    - Preserves the most recent or most complete information
    - Maintains an audit trail of merged records
  </Step>
</Steps>
